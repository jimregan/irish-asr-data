0:01:55,349 --> 0:01:58,819
knights in after the contras that annie just don't get

33
0:01:58,829 --> 0:02:02,140
cooperation of so many people thought that this is a

34
0:02:02,150 --> 0:02:06,799
testament to the vibrancy any organize a state that that

35
0:02:06,810 --> 0:02:10,389
is there a diamonds farming community so is the amount

36
0:02:10,400 --> 0:02:14,060
is still don't have talked i want to congratulate and

37
0:02:14,069 --> 0:02:17,740
tanks are all the neighboring farm estimate as to take

38
0:02:17,749 --> 0:02:22,430
it that transformation of six hundred acres of farmland although

39
0:02:22,439 --> 0:02:25,680
i'm told this morning it's the urges that mounted into

40
0:02:25,689 --> 0:02:28,000
our hands farming capital city

41
0:02:28,580 --> 0:02:30,919
at the time the lazy efforts of life and that

42
0:02:31,259 --> 0:02:34,509
is him out this in incarnate all of us have

43
0:02:34,520 --> 0:02:38,240
acted expensive and development of the event is doing is

44
0:02:38,249 --> 0:02:41,379
it's not to mention to the day case evidence that

45
0:02:41,389 --> 0:02:44,199
crowd associations are denied the sea

46
0:02:44,919 --> 0:02:48,840
including it's a garza both on the diplomatic director for

47
0:02:48,849 --> 0:02:57,870
decades and they may kill that crap had gave a

48
0:02:57,879 --> 0:03:02,319
commitment from the organizing group bennett who is yet what

49
0:03:02,330 --> 0:03:04,810
about all of us and which is it might fat

50
0:03:04,819 --> 0:03:08,729
and why deprivation is an outgrowth of last year after

51
0:03:08,740 --> 0:03:11,780
year economy and enjoy these days yet

52
0:03:12,460 --> 0:03:15,060
and they have a lot of a corporation

53
0:03:15,520 --> 0:03:18,129
while the crowd because of that got the dead many

54
0:03:18,189 --> 0:03:22,449
probably organizations is i'll come to get any great act

55
0:03:22,659 --> 0:03:26,520
of enthusiasm and cooperation to make is that of a possible

56
0:03:28,099 --> 0:03:31,740
right that corporation is indecision parts of rural life

57
0:03:32,789 --> 0:03:35,460
and i think you have created and says david the

58
0:03:35,469 --> 0:03:40,740
championship making it the most important enjoy the separation of rhode island

59
0:03:41,340 --> 0:03:43,249
what i did not ask next

60
0:03:43,680 --> 0:03:44,969
and i knew it save it

61
0:03:45,699 --> 0:03:46,930
the little bow

62
0:03:47,259 --> 0:03:50,139
and you don't slap at cost billions because their farming

63
0:03:50,580 --> 0:03:54,060
of nardone are holed by ozarks society

64
0:03:54,749 --> 0:03:58,669
our landscapes are natural environment and our way of life

65
0:03:59,789 --> 0:04:03,539
anything on his desk at the championships that falling

66
0:04:03,909 --> 0:04:07,569
an annual pledge an easy call is so fidelity will

67
0:04:07,639 --> 0:04:09,000
to our talents is easy

68
0:04:09,659 --> 0:04:12,680
you got that guys thought that connects it with a

69
0:04:12,689 --> 0:04:15,979
lot of communities and that it went on about that

70
0:04:15,990 --> 0:04:17,300
very fast bra

71
0:04:18,470 --> 0:04:21,779
and i didn't get writing these days there's senate race

72
0:04:21,790 --> 0:04:24,249
in an adult which you're easy i want to say

73
0:04:24,259 --> 0:04:28,360
is when did say heels of the profile role of

74
0:04:28,720 --> 0:04:31,870
that crap hasn't found a safe in our society

75
0:04:32,810 --> 0:04:35,399
ephemeral and it could be fully understood

76
0:04:35,899 --> 0:04:40,079
now doctor rieders insane statistics on that alpha sector

77
0:04:41,100 --> 0:04:46,660
indeed indicators of any importance in the important indicator what'd

78
0:04:46,670 --> 0:04:50,370
they don't have money taking took on a young hawkins

79
0:04:50,379 --> 0:04:52,079
that bombing as a way of life

80
0:04:53,120 --> 0:04:55,339
about onassis' family farming

81
0:04:55,610 --> 0:04:57,579
and it's still good does he need to have all

82
0:04:57,589 --> 0:05:00,519
hate to see and that didn't get it so many young people

83
0:05:01,410 --> 0:05:04,120
it's our money that can access our lasted eight sir

84
0:05:04,620 --> 0:05:07,019
when all of that france has not only did not

85
0:05:07,029 --> 0:05:12,009
it's awful insecurity and it's importance from generation to generation

86
0:05:12,699 --> 0:05:15,589
but also that in that in no or understanding

87
0:05:16,269 --> 0:05:20,910
that caused brought being close to sell it and those plants

88
0:05:21,470 --> 0:05:23,199
given that in a way of life

89
0:05:23,930 --> 0:05:25,079
it needs and arthur

90
0:05:25,680 --> 0:05:28,529
he supports the generous standing

91
0:05:29,110 --> 0:05:33,920
it needs good still set policies as well as economic crisis intervention

92
0:05:34,990 --> 0:05:37,589
and i understand that i would be visited today

93
0:05:38,089 --> 0:05:41,009
i'm activities it would be as that jackass

94
0:05:42,170 --> 0:05:44,370
and that was preparing my notes

95
0:05:44,920 --> 0:05:48,139
is that indebted to what they've been written by david matter

96
0:05:48,980 --> 0:05:52,180
on the chances are not crazy glue and communities

97
0:05:52,939 --> 0:05:55,149
that they had a lot of things that i'm not

98
0:05:55,160 --> 0:05:59,139
that they use the national guards are dead two thousand and fifteen

99
0:05:59,920 --> 0:06:02,579
that's all to get one thousand three

100
0:06:02,990 --> 0:06:06,259
in fact article president where bomb ripped up

101
0:06:06,680 --> 0:06:10,060
no environment because they didn't have an office hours studying

102
0:06:10,069 --> 0:06:14,050
come to a farm are sprouts and aziz and who

103
0:06:14,060 --> 0:06:17,920
did it eddie got promise that we can have found

104
0:06:17,930 --> 0:06:20,499
is that the chair because they may not be viable

105
0:06:21,870 --> 0:06:26,089
my mistake to sit as president of ireland filing past

106
0:06:26,100 --> 0:06:27,040
to be supportive

107
0:06:27,699 --> 0:06:30,910
as part of our economy yes they had records sector

108
0:06:31,350 --> 0:06:33,579
these are not as they did to his industry

109
0:06:34,240 --> 0:06:37,730
and it's contribution to the nation and overproduction of old

110
0:06:38,160 --> 0:06:43,259
friend expanding population is significant and since it operates in

111
0:06:43,269 --> 0:06:47,589
our world community is it provides elicited in cobb had

112
0:06:47,600 --> 0:06:50,589
gone and what else it makes you is that accurate

113
0:06:50,600 --> 0:06:53,279
happen or zeller says about about

114
0:06:54,959 --> 0:06:57,870
get out from all the time then the end

115
0:06:58,269 --> 0:07:02,449
our exports are hotter than sixty thousand jobs

116
0:07:03,519 --> 0:07:06,579
i think that their contract has been and continues to

117
0:07:06,589 --> 0:07:10,040
be sensitive issues beat out the future of our country

118
0:07:10,310 --> 0:07:14,529
and our society are that it did begin i didn't

119
0:07:14,540 --> 0:07:16,360
like it here is in and talking yet at the

120
0:07:16,370 --> 0:07:17,379

acknowledging these factors are quiet acknowledgment us at effect on

130
0:07:53,699 --> 0:07:57,699
that road a box and that is the unbalanced nature

0:07:57,939 --> 0:07:59,540
of development and arnett

132
0:08:00,540 --> 0:08:03,779
that and that is developments is leaving us with a

133
0:08:03,790 --> 0:08:06,670
role in the peace in some parts and then

134
0:08:07,129 --> 0:08:11,430
also the oddest right of declined our been these economies

0:10:53,940 --> 0:10:57,049
it was clearly is a nineteen days on the path

180
0:10:57,059 --> 0:10:58,690
as a consensus oh

181
0:10:59,129 --> 0:11:03,059
most of us notion infrastructure and i've been road you've

182
0:11:03,070 --> 0:11:05,179
got the nation and vicious cycle

183
0:11:05,850 --> 0:11:09,110
and i think it's the obvious what is the prize

184
0:11:09,159 --> 0:11:12,700
is the intervention no maughan in relation to that sages

185
0:11:12,710 --> 0:11:17,179
as dated say it applies the activity of enacted on

186
0:11:17,190 --> 0:11:18,779
secretary of state

187
0:11:20,090 --> 0:11:23,110
i think about artist made dad effects of this city

188
0:11:23,909 --> 0:11:27,269
when the bluth max did seats back instead the city

189
0:11:27,279 --> 0:11:31,460
plan to exoneration very serious than anticipated

190
0:11:32,190 --> 0:11:36,269
i'll be inadequate service provision scholar that crowd get red

191
0:11:36,279 --> 0:11:40,110
herrings that can see at about seven or that and

192
0:11:40,120 --> 0:11:44,379
then of course there are other specific issues associated with

193
0:11:44,389 --> 0:11:45,230
life in this city

194
0:11:45,809 --> 0:11:48,409
spiraling costs associated with housing

195
0:11:48,929 --> 0:11:52,470
and our associated with bullets speculation and to be added

196
0:11:52,480 --> 0:11:57,299
a provision of housing on conservation disillusioned fragmentation

197
0:11:58,559 --> 0:12:01,590
would yell at me that i denied today i want to say

198
0:12:02,350 --> 0:12:03,580
we should try megan

199
0:12:03,899 --> 0:12:08,019
the case that is there are patterns legion idea that

200
0:12:08,470 --> 0:12:12,409
having a lot to make amends should she be at madison society

201
0:12:13,049 --> 0:12:17,350
and the giants are providing and revitalizing rhode island

202
0:12:18,330 --> 0:12:21,200
the n. not talking about it as a kind of

203
0:12:21,210 --> 0:12:23,700
a case you have to respect the day that no

204
0:12:23,710 --> 0:12:24,419
way of life

205
0:12:24,980 --> 0:12:26,629
and it is tempting we eat

206
0:12:27,440 --> 0:12:29,490
it's like a great challenges that are trying

207
0:12:30,009 --> 0:12:32,230
it's one that can and must be next

208
0:12:33,070 --> 0:12:34,259
can i take it as well

209
0:12:35,360 --> 0:12:38,230
is that the the negatives about mars and venus griping

210
0:12:38,899 --> 0:12:42,549
we have the means to science and technology and communications

211
0:12:42,860 --> 0:12:45,529
to the jaw that the defense cuts is that outpaced

212
0:12:45,539 --> 0:12:50,620
the thermal community and as a direct relationship between ronald

213
0:12:50,629 --> 0:12:56,190
ronald b. is this promenade main infrastructure and was that be described

214
0:12:57,389 --> 0:13:01,610
i didn't associate kite technology and science

215
0:13:02,289 --> 0:13:06,580
crafted infrastructure expenditure of economic social and take it that time

216
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:08,809
and it has achieved our charts

217
0:13:09,559 --> 0:13:12,440
an awesome by prince by you know it's a new

218
0:13:12,450 --> 0:13:13,700
disease is not in evidence

219
0:13:14,740 --> 0:13:19,539
it's not the result awesome natural phenomena as they did

220
0:13:19,549 --> 0:13:22,779
a hideous some way of the work that jacket is

221
0:13:22,789 --> 0:13:25,830
the case now and there is at it sounds as

222
0:13:26,139 --> 0:13:27,129
nice and small

223
0:13:27,509 --> 0:13:30,710
our fate has to make choices at human is effect

224
0:13:30,720 --> 0:13:32,090
that the that'd be described

225
0:13:32,870 --> 0:13:33,960
there are choices

226
0:13:34,389 --> 0:13:37,159
there are fading and our state change

227
0:13:37,720 --> 0:13:40,929
and we need to go we envision it imagination if

228
0:13:40,940 --> 0:13:42,600
they don't be late bath

229
0:13:43,490 --> 0:13:44,139
i think

230
0:13:45,179 --> 0:13:46,909
something that's been parked

231
0:13:47,509 --> 0:13:50,929
is that important that that then last thing we get

232
0:13:50,940 --> 0:13:54,330
away from over to buy between city and caught

233
0:13:55,110 --> 0:13:57,419
if there are problems in the wooten is in the

234
0:13:57,429 --> 0:14:01,509
population yeah kind of easy to that problem is all

235
0:14:01,519 --> 0:14:05,169
kinds population increase in the city and i'm making my

236
0:14:05,179 --> 0:14:08,649
case i gain for me to that because by the

237
0:14:08,659 --> 0:14:12,149
visiting our address is that in fact it's absolutely do

238
0:14:12,159 --> 0:14:16,019
not plan by this thing and ruined infrastructure transport and

239
0:14:16,029 --> 0:14:20,090
brought back by providing good business at all i get

240
0:14:20,100 --> 0:14:23,690
a grasp that made a profit important for people to

241
0:14:23,700 --> 0:14:27,749
go back again and a great flirting ignites the dullest

242
0:14:27,759 --> 0:14:31,220
towns and villages where you see too many businesses fellas

243
0:14:31,230 --> 0:14:39,529
got hump and added friend i felt as far as

244
0:14:39,539 --> 0:14:40,330
the point of view

245
0:14:41,240 --> 0:14:44,700
this is easily get it basically do that because they

246
0:14:44,710 --> 0:14:48,289
only need aspiring india's economy and then i

247
0:14:48,809 --> 0:14:53,679
in continue interaction between added run exchanges would be sustainable

248
0:14:54,639 --> 0:14:58,289
yes it is next year at into the white sustained

249
0:14:58,950 --> 0:15:02,789
did yeah marks the end of second anniversary of the

250
0:15:02,799 --> 0:15:06,990
adoption of the two thousand and the sustainable development goal

251
0:15:07,679 --> 0:15:11,230
when the great achievements of my time is present in

252
0:15:11,240 --> 0:15:14,629
two thousand eighty to all our hearts need to we

253
0:15:14,639 --> 0:15:17,980
have long asked him that he leads the of looked

254
0:15:17,990 --> 0:15:18,749
in the economy

255
0:15:19,570 --> 0:15:22,460
treads threads that ellis island i see that was then

256
0:15:22,470 --> 0:15:26,450
that maybe late last week that natural why are animal

257
0:15:26,460 --> 0:15:28,769
is that we've been asked to do is that they

258
0:15:28,779 --> 0:15:31,669
get great go to our mad man and woman knows

259
0:15:32,179 --> 0:15:36,499
that he can now and he lobbied the he says

260
0:15:36,509 --> 0:15:39,309
the idea we have to do it if

261
0:15:46,240 --> 0:15:48,980
that's that's where i says by the r. j. r.

262
0:15:48,990 --> 0:15:52,340
our generation but the rule that the generations to come

263
0:15:52,840 --> 0:15:55,149
and dole is both need all of our civil war

264
0:15:55,590 --> 0:15:57,899
and it's good to see all the young people predicted

265
0:15:57,909 --> 0:16:00,639
vichy year here i will take at least go and

266
0:16:00,649 --> 0:16:03,960
make fill it in the giant no solid colors of

267
0:16:03,970 --> 0:16:07,409
the apartment at x. good farming

268
0:16:01,559 --> 0:16:03,360
that's a classic station and farm

269
0:16:03,970 --> 0:16:05,950
that applies to you do now

270
0:16:06,519 --> 0:16:10,230
between five and seven sons and daughters and maps and

271
0:16:10,240 --> 0:16:12,749
i think that is that it is one of the

272
0:16:12,759 --> 0:16:13,809
test of our time

273
0:16:14,490 --> 0:16:17,879
you know when behind we will resume at that rate

274
0:16:18,399 --> 0:16:20,809
by doesn't that mean then that the head of the

275
0:16:20,820 --> 0:16:24,899
sector in agriculture must include although so far

276
0:16:25,330 --> 0:16:27,480
and as latest project ten inches too

277
0:16:28,289 --> 0:16:31,909
yes it is possible across the atlantic avenue to magic

278
0:16:31,919 --> 0:16:35,929
kind yes sally management and that is as to the

279
0:16:36,409 --> 0:16:37,340
great human energy

280
0:16:37,929 --> 0:16:40,090
new policy to many spaceship many

281
0:16:40,539 --> 0:16:43,870
education system that takes the concept of richness of their

282
0:16:43,879 --> 0:16:48,649
own experience so sensitive and al at that he didn't

283
0:16:48,840 --> 0:16:53,029
do was we say describing assets internationally in foreign policy

284
0:16:53,700 --> 0:16:54,990
olive that mutating

285
0:16:55,700 --> 0:16:59,610
must be beaten us thrown away and as artifacts an

286
0:16:59,620 --> 0:17:00,960
item that is very improper

287
0:17:01,860 --> 0:17:04,059
that's a one of the great successes when i go

288
0:17:04,069 --> 0:17:06,349
to build a way that comes out

289
0:17:06,910 --> 0:17:10,240
is the importance now that the text internationally and it's

290
0:17:10,249 --> 0:17:12,319
going to be dead and that it's less as we

291
0:17:12,329 --> 0:17:15,670
speak to retain i'll knock heads for that because her

292
0:17:15,680 --> 0:17:17,349
projects face it is

293
0:17:18,339 --> 0:17:20,289
but i do want to say this is way out

294
0:17:21,019 --> 0:17:23,970
we need say today he not only in the projects

295
0:17:24,319 --> 0:17:28,170
from full extent of the drug activity said we need

296
0:17:28,180 --> 0:17:31,940
say sedated he's every stage of production at least at

297
0:17:31,950 --> 0:17:35,619
safe and about to leave that the venue as haley

298
0:17:35,630 --> 0:17:39,749
states to adapt to their weekend caught at it we

299
0:17:39,759 --> 0:17:41,210
don't have a divinity

300
0:17:41,690 --> 0:17:45,440
i had to that made with daddy by tuesday about

301
0:17:45,650 --> 0:17:49,339
acting is largesse of all we said yesterday that just

302
0:17:49,349 --> 0:17:53,249
makes it necessary to ensure that there are their transactions

303
0:17:53,490 --> 0:17:57,019
between those who refuse bill to practice for the retail

304
0:17:57,029 --> 0:18:05,430
sector and those who've been filled up one and i

305
0:18:05,440 --> 0:18:09,230
think you fools wisely date sweetie pie has that

306
0:18:09,869 --> 0:18:13,380
environment is as big a vision and economics as they

307
0:18:13,390 --> 0:18:17,400
did anything anywhere and compliments it i'm one cabinet he

308
0:18:17,410 --> 0:18:19,319
cheats at the expense of the yacht

309
0:18:19,839 --> 0:18:24,599
i see a product that document going to these guys have budgets

310
0:18:25,079 --> 0:18:29,180
iran great opportunity to send a great tradition not i'd

311
0:18:29,190 --> 0:18:34,499
get a hat imagination and principally about farming sector and

312
0:18:34,509 --> 0:18:37,420
i need we need to mobilize all of the madness

313
0:18:37,430 --> 0:18:40,440
of our society in haiti the day that i can

314
0:18:40,450 --> 0:18:44,519
describe believe him out of rotting food production we came

315
0:18:44,529 --> 0:18:48,339
and carves out with a dish a new ideas you

316
0:18:48,349 --> 0:18:52,579
escape and met with any bank that dennis franz had

317
0:18:52,589 --> 0:18:57,480
any information and exchanging best practice at cross and major garrett

318
0:18:58,569 --> 0:18:58,960
thought

319
0:18:59,730 --> 0:19:03,220
out yeah they have pot belly like a means and

320
0:19:03,230 --> 0:19:06,650
so on that in about two outfits that and that

321
0:19:06,660 --> 0:19:09,499
is what is the day in part to easy so

322
0:19:09,509 --> 0:19:12,650
much more than a sector and we have gone this

323
0:19:12,660 --> 0:19:16,390
is one good example of federal programs that could or

324
0:19:16,400 --> 0:19:19,529
boudreau grab the j. c. a different approach to fighting

325
0:19:19,539 --> 0:19:22,049
and conservation from the ground up

326
0:19:22,499 --> 0:19:24,559
analysts i want to see as as as well

327
0:19:25,109 --> 0:19:29,299
a happier place for some animosity well if that is saying

328
0:19:29,779 --> 0:19:31,759
wet blood stains that made a bayonet

329
0:19:32,150 --> 0:19:35,390
i'm really implemented and a lady who after goldfarb

330
0:19:35,980 --> 0:19:37,259
and i had id

331
0:19:37,710 --> 0:19:40,769
we must don't cooperate in dealing with what it really

332
0:19:40,779 --> 0:19:44,400
is not discuss and that is correct yes i think

333
0:19:44,410 --> 0:19:47,440
we've lost that just getting into the rise in lagos

334
0:19:47,450 --> 0:19:50,259
in fact it did in our maybe because of its

335
0:19:50,269 --> 0:19:53,569
age of the cards i had talked to president of

336
0:19:53,579 --> 0:19:56,640
bosnia as part of the advertising sector goes to the

337
0:19:56,650 --> 0:19:57,920
united kingdom out

338
0:19:58,809 --> 0:20:00,049
well is that all this

339
0:20:00,480 --> 0:20:03,789
don't you consume irish film know that i guess in

340
0:20:03,799 --> 0:20:07,980
the best quality hello dreyfus was held at all events

341
0:20:08,619 --> 0:20:11,009
felt that while we have had faith that they've been

342
0:20:11,019 --> 0:20:14,680
to get ready to costume with a sense to you

343
0:20:14,690 --> 0:20:17,890
and i aced a seven and brought up and yet

344
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:21,390
we would go and find you laughed when we mistake

345
0:20:21,400 --> 0:20:24,089
did your the markets we had and that's why i

346
0:20:24,099 --> 0:20:27,029
think it's a vote that that meant as a key

347
0:20:27,410 --> 0:20:30,359
in recognition of the vatican and eat about that in

348
0:20:30,369 --> 0:20:33,499
every exit and go see it no we don't need

349
0:20:33,720 --> 0:20:37,069
i have bought the only yes we do want to

350
0:20:37,130 --> 0:20:40,519
see me about goldman and yet we want to attack

351
0:20:40,529 --> 0:20:43,259
the state with sector that are very important to us

352
0:20:43,509 --> 0:20:45,819
and they want the job done or not

353
0:20:46,490 --> 0:20:50,130
and we always had from accept either and i want

354
0:20:50,140 --> 0:20:52,660
to say to us president i'm in there would have

355
0:20:52,670 --> 0:20:56,779
to have brought had it tastes enliven his accidents their

356
0:20:56,789 --> 0:21:00,680
friendship extended towards island is alice who'll midwest

357
0:21:02,499 --> 0:21:03,420
and it's not

358
0:21:03,799 --> 0:21:06,670
sydney and i'm good at the invitation of batman

359
0:21:07,279 --> 0:21:10,400
cedras may yet and you see the and i have

360
0:21:10,539 --> 0:21:12,339
found that winning isn't the westcott

361
0:21:12,890 --> 0:21:15,220
i did a little uneasy is as we get it

362
0:21:15,920 --> 0:21:19,349
and these would provide opportunities for producers and ex parte

363
0:21:19,359 --> 0:21:22,799
as abrogate the first to market for u. n. a

364
0:21:22,809 --> 0:21:26,190
nice guy that our konzi's histories that kind of you

366
0:21:30,029 --> 0:21:33,819
and they didn't exist between our people back to abide

367
0:21:33,829 --> 0:21:37,339
by the yen asked megan's back and then president of

368
