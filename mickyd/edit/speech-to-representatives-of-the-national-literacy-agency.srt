47
0:02:51,310 --> 0:02:55,530
changing experience as it is for everyone but each and

0:03:13,740 --> 0:03:16,069
of my life so i want to come into for

54
0:03:16,080 --> 0:03:19,719
your car eight hundred to terminate the day i was

at in a particular story for example and before us

57
0:03:26,060 --> 0:03:30,289
today and when he described for us to form a

58
0:03:30,300 --> 0:03:34,189
pinky psychiatrist chartered and his journey toward the national debt

59
0:03:34,199 --> 0:03:37,990
to new jersey agency's work i think it's very very

60
0:03:38,030 --> 0:03:40,610
very moving and to keep the change honest to the

61
0:03:40,620 --> 0:03:45,120
treaty emaciated shouldn't speak to an describing something that is

62
0:03:45,129 --> 0:03:47,830
not easy for anyone to do this it's a shame

63
0:03:47,840 --> 0:03:52,129
frustration and failure to preaching difficulties creation for him was

64
0:03:52,139 --> 0:03:57,610
deeply moving as these basics strong sentence that is so

65
0:03:57,620 --> 0:04:00,009
subtle now he said he wanted to be at the

0:04:00,020 --> 0:04:03,139
ramada for his chicken and to be a bit to

67
0:04:03,150 --> 0:04:07,930
purchase a page engage patron and i think that all

68
0:04:07,939 --> 0:04:12,479
of those stories which of necessity that derek's on the street

69
0:04:13,749 --> 0:04:17,709
off peak of taken current trends will persevere to the

70
0:04:17,720 --> 0:04:18,839
face it difficult to

71
0:04:19,550 --> 0:04:23,550
acting he's willing to succeed is apocalypse just for anyone

72
0:04:23,560 --> 0:04:26,350
who may feed his car if i might just it

141
0:08:35,350 --> 0:08:38,799
very very important i've no doubt that these initiatives we'd

142
0:08:38,809 --> 0:08:44,230
be instrumental in changing eventually see key figure i spoke

the ion and the result of us at painful cuts

192
0:11:52,769 --> 0:11:58,549
both generations ever hit the h. i. and having knowlton

193
0:11:58,639 --> 0:12:03,389

fiske and economic interest

202

understanding boxes in fact happening in relation to options that

203
0:12:37,360 --> 0:12:40,860
are justified to the faces of fiske imperatives of our

204
0:12:40,870 --> 0:12:44,289
economic issues that he's going to be just as important

205
0:12:44,830 --> 0:12:47,840

our citizens to understand is enough weight to send to

215
0:13:18,460 --> 0:13:21,360
