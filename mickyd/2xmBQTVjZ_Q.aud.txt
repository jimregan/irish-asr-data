43.0	46.0	amach eh dear friends and distinguished
46.0	49.0	guests I just wanted to say on behalf of
49.0	52.0	Sabine and myself let me thank you most
52.0	54.0	sincerely for joining us on this joyous
54.0	58.0	occasion a very important occasion thank
58.0	62.0	you for braving the elements for the
62.0	65.0	unveiling of Rachel Joynt's what is just
65.0	68.0	a stunning work Dearcan na nDaoine the
68.0	71.0	people's acorn now there are so many
71.0	73.0	people involved in the creation of this
73.0	76.0	work that we literally couldn't fit you
76.0	78.0	all in one room and the Áras and so
78.0	81.0	this event has been as they would say in
81.0	83.0	the GAA in two parts and just before they
83.0	87.0	unveiling I spoke to a hundred and
87.0	89.0	seventy children from seven schools in
89.0	92.0	different parts of this island and now
92.0	95.0	I have an opportunity of speaking to
95.0	97.0	yourselves
97.0	99.0	may I just say as well because I think
99.0	102.0	it's important that from the very
102.0	104.0	beginning the idea that we would have
104.0	105.0	something to recall all of those events
105.0	108.0	of 1916 was something that was
108.0	111.0	incredibly important to Sabina
111.0	114.0	Saidhbhín mo bhean chéile anseo now
114.0	122.0	I've mentioned the seven schools and to
122.0	125.0	their teachers and all of the children
125.0	126.0	that we have just left and and how
126.0	129.0	enthusiastic they were but I also
129.0	131.0	wanted to work on the Beal- uh  some
131.0	134.0	special people the Bealtaine writers
134.0	137.0	group from the Lourde's Day Center in
137.0	140.0	Sean McDermott Street they gave of their
140.0	143.0	time and to work with Rachel Joynte and
143.0	147.0	poet Enda Wyley to share their
147.0	150.0	memories and their perspectives on life
150.0	153.0	in Ireland it is very important that we
153.0	156.0	don't fall into a terrible fallacy of
156.0	159.0	assuming that older people just do
159.0	161.0	memories and younger people just do
161.0	163.0	dreams and both in fact do very very
163.0	167.0	well together with their words and
167.0	170.0	thoughts on those occasions they met
170.0	172.0	Rachel and Enda that they're now
172.0	176.0	sealed within the sculpture and they'll
176.0	178.0	be pondered over with the others by
178.0	181.0	the children of the 22nd century and
181.0	184.0	your names are tell them they'll now will
184.0	187.0	like those of each of the children who
187.0	188.0	were with us earlier will be forever
188.0	190.0	etched on Dearcan na nDaoine in fact it
190.0	193.0	was wonderful to see the children
193.0	195.0	finding their names on the beautiful
195.0	197.0	piece I do want particularly to recall
197.0	202.0	Elizabeth O’Carroll who chaired the Bealtaine
202.0	204.0	group's input to the project em
204.0	207.0	Elizabeth died since the workshop and I
207.0	211.0	was very pleased earlier to have the
211.0	213.0	opportunity of meeting Tom and you are
213.0	215.0	so welcome fíor-chaoin fáilte romhat go?
215.0	217.0	speisialta chomh maith
217.0	221.0	I know that Elizabeth is not only missed
221.0	227.0	of course by her family but by all of
227.0	229.0	the members and friends in the Bealtaine
229.0	231.0	group since 2012[two thousand and twelve] we've been
231.0	236.0	collectively engaged in a period of
236.0	238.0	reflection a decade of commemoration on
238.0	242.0	the momentous of events of a century ago
242.0	244.0	that would lead to why people like me
244.0	248.0	and you are standing here in the home
248.0	250.0	of the President of Ireland lead to an
250.0	252.0	independent state these events led to
252.0	256.0	the partition of Ireland and they would
256.0	257.0	eventually leave to lead to the
257.0	259.0	birth of a republic and it was as we
259.0	264.0	were here eh and walking around the the grounds
264.0	268.0	that Sabina and I decided that Áras an
268.0	271.0	Uachtarán the home of the President of
271.0	273.0	Ireland should mark these centenary
273.0	276.0	commemorations not only through
276.0	278.0	the hosting of events and I think I
278.0	280.0	spoke in 2016 at six hundred events but I
280.0	284.0	think that we should also  do
284.0	288.0	something that would leave a permanent
288.0	290.0	artistic reflection and interpretation
290.0	294.0	of what we had been doing by way of
294.0	296.0	reflection and for example in the same
296.0	300.0	spirit next year we will install an
300.0	303.0	artwork another one public piece for the
303.0	307.0	those who will visit the Áras
307.0	309.0	commemorating the 1913 lock out but today
309.0	313.0	we're celebra- recalling the Easter
313.0	315.0	Rising with what I can just say is I
315.0	318.0	believe is a very beautiful new addition
318.0	320.0	to the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin what we
320.0	324.0	sought was an artistic piece that would
324.0	326.0	be an appropriate and permanent tribute
326.0	328.0	to the women and men whose effort and
328.0	331.0	sacrifice contributed so much to Irish
331.0	334.0	freedom that would be a symbol that
334.0	337.0	would also serve as an inspiration
337.0	339.0	towards realizing the promise of a real
339.0	343.0	republic a true Republic which is of
343.0	346.0	course a prospect that remains as a
346.0	348.0	challenge for us all and will be a
348.0	351.0	source of reflection for those who visit
351.0	353.0	the beautiful sculpture today I want
353.0	356.0	especially to welcome ach go háirithe
356.0	359.0	the I want to welcome the relatives of the
359.0	362.0	signatories of the proclamation who're
362.0	364.0	here and over the other participants in
364.0	366.0	the rising of joined us for for this
366.0	369.0	occasion fíor-chaoin speisialta 
369.0	372.0	fáilte romhaibh a chairde is tá súil a'am go
372.0	374.0	mbraitheann sibh go bhfuil Dearcán na nDaoine
374.0	377.0	mar shiombal oiriúnach [den fhís a leag bhur ngaolta]
377.0	380.0	ós ár gcomhair ar an Luan 
380.0	383.0	Cásca sin ós cionn céad bliain ó shin.
383.0	386.0	are in I'm so pleased that you have been
386.0	388.0	able to join us and I hope that you when
388.0	391.0	you visit when you see that you will
391.0	393.0	regard it as a worthy symbol of the
393.0	395.0	generous actions of your ancestors I
395.0	398.0	hope that what we have achieved with
398.0	400.0	this commemorative work will be a
400.0	402.0	fitting tribute to the memory and vision
402.0	405.0	the signatories of the proclamation but
405.0	408.0	also all those who stood with them and
408.0	410.0	those who would recoil afterwards and
410.0	414.0	sup- to their fate and who would be
414.0	416.0	part of their vision it is an accolade I
416.0	419.0	think to our shared past and it is in
419.0	422.0	this way also when you look at the Acorn
422.0	425.0	and the time capsule within it it is
425.0	427.0	a wonderful a beacon for a brighter
427.0	431.0	future all of us as citizens of Ireland
431.0	434.0	are now living in an Ireland that was
434.0	437.0	shaped by the actions and vision of your
437.0	439.0	ancestors who with other men and women
439.0	442.0	took to the streets on Easter Monday
442.0	444.0	1916 to make a demand for independence
444.0	448.0	and to spo- respond directly to the
448.0	452.0	consequences of imperialism in Ireland
452.0	455.0	there were those who participated were
455.0	459.0	women and men who risked everything in
459.0	461.0	their different ways fighting for
461.0	463.0	freedom and inspired by the declaration
463.0	466.0	of a republic and the dream of a better
466.0	468.0	fairer inclusive new future and we
468.0	473.0	should not forget that the rebels while
473.0	475.0	there were a group that had a variety of
475.0	477.0	talents tallainne éigine acu
477.0	480.0	they had a shared belief in the
480.0	482.0	independence of Ireland amongst their
482.0	485.0	number were socialists feminists
485.0	487.0	Republicans devout Catholics Protestants
487.0	490.0	atheists radicals and other ideologies
490.0	494.0	and somewhere several of these all at
494.0	497.0	the one time but in their different ways
497.0	500.0	they shared a dream of an alternative
500.0	502.0	existence to that of subjugation of the
502.0	505.0	Irish people and their culture and they
505.0	508.0	rejected any imposed deference to Empire
508.0	512.0	I've mentioned my speeches during 2016
512.0	516.0	they emphasized that all of the
516.0	519.0	participants in it 1916 and indeed those
519.0	523.0	of the decades of the revival that went
523.0	526.0	before had come to procede and recoil
526.0	529.0	from what was a constant theme in the
529.0	533.0	assumptions of the imperialist mind it
533.0	536.0	was that those dominated in any
536.0	538.0	colony such as Ireland was somehow lesser
538.0	541.0	in human terms in language culture and
541.0	544.0	politics the historical evidence for
544.0	547.0	this view was all around in the
547.0	551.0	circumstances of housing hunger
551.0	554.0	immigration exclusion language loss and
554.0	558.0	above all in cultural assumptions as the
558.0	562.0	culture of freedom that was allowed was
562.0	564.0	a freedom merely to imitate or a
564.0	568.0	suggestion to ingratiate while the
568.0	571.0	vision for the future of those we recall
571.0	573.0	and honour today was set out in the
573.0	576.0	proclamation I think it can I think be
576.0	579.0	be viewed in retrospect as a challenge
579.0	583.0	which remains for us succeeding
583.0	586.0	generations an ideal that has yet to be
586.0	589.0	achieved tone blue long on fools it was
589.0	593.0	such thoughts and reflections that drove
593.0	596.0	sabine and i as we walked around these
596.0	598.0	groan to say something must be here to
598.0	602.0	sit down a challenge dennis which we
602.0	604.0	sought to our own artists in this
604.0	607.0	challenge was to capture in the one work
607.0	609.0	the foundations we have been bequeathed
609.0	611.0	by that
611.0	613.0	evolutionary generation and those that
613.0	616.0	succeeded the part that all of us are
616.0	619.0	called upon and have the opportunity to
619.0	622.0	play in our national project our
622.0	624.0	national story as we seek to achieve the
624.0	627.0	promise and potential of the future for
627.0	630.0	all our people so often in my speeches
630.0	633.0	of 2016 I spoke about our veteran take
633.0	637.0	on children at the on do it to this end
637.0	640.0	in 2015 we invited renowned artists and
640.0	643.0	sculptors to make proposals for such an
643.0	646.0	artwork to be placed here in the grounds
646.0	649.0	of arsenic draw on each of the sculptors
649.0	652.0	was highly accomplished and they all had
652.0	654.0	reputations as exceptional artists who
654.0	657.0	were confidential would bring reflective
657.0	659.0	and imaginative ideas to the project
659.0	662.0	without light we were delighted at the
662.0	665.0	positive and enthusiastic response we
665.0	667.0	received some of the 14 artists who
667.0	670.0	submitted proposals are with us today me

685.0	687.0	and inspiring ideas that you put forward
687.0	690.0	we realized from the beginning the
690.0	693.0	choosing all the profound and very
693.0	695.0	different from between all the profound
695.0	697.0	a very different proposals would require
697.0	700.0	the application of exceptional and
700.0	703.0	experienced individuals who together
703.0	705.0	could discern the most appropriate
705.0	707.0	sculpture for its intended session so we
707.0	712.0	were absolutely delighted when our very
712.0	715.0	first choice of jury members to oversee

738.0	740.0	which involves several stages of
740.0	743.0	consideration interrogation and
743.0	745.0	distillation the jury was expertly
745.0	748.0	chaired by Katrina Crowe who under whose
