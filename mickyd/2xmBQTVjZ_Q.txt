00:46
amach eh dear friends and distinguished
00:49
guests I just wanted to say on behalf of
00:52
Sabine and myself let me thank you most
00:54
sincerely for joining us on this joyous
00:58
occasion a very important occasion thank
01:02
you for braving the elements for the
01:05
unveiling of Rachel Joynt's what is just
01:08
a stunning work Dearcan na nDaoine the
01:11
people's acorn now there are so many
01:13
people involved in the creation of this
01:16
work that we literally couldn't fit you
01:18
all in one room and the Áras and so
01:21
this event has been as they would say in
01:23
the GAA in two parts and just before they
01:27
unveiling I spoke to a hundred and
01:29
seventy children from seven schools in
01:32
different parts of this island and now
01:35
I have an opportunity of speaking to
01:37
yourselves
01:39
may I just say as well because I think
01:42
it's important that from the very
01:44
beginning the idea that we would have
01:45
something to recall all of those events
01:48
of 1916 was something that was
01:51
incredibly important to Sabina
01:54
Saidhbhín mo bhean chéile anseo now
02:02
I've mentioned the seven schools and to
02:05
their teachers and all of the children
02:06
that we have just left and and how
02:09
enthusiastic they were but I also
02:11
wanted to work on the Beal- uh  some
02:14
special people the Bealtaine writers
02:17
group from the Lourde's Day Center in
02:20
Sean McDermott Street they gave of their
02:23
time and to work with Rachel Joynte and
02:27
poet Enda Wyley to share their
02:30
memories and their perspectives on life
02:33
in Ireland it is very important that we
02:36
don't fall into a terrible fallacy of
02:39
assuming that older people just do
02:41
memories and younger people just do
02:43
dreams and both in fact do very very
02:47
well together with their words and
02:50
thoughts on those occasions they met
02:52
Rachel and Enda that they're now
02:56
sealed within the sculpture and they'll
02:58
be pondered over with the others by
03:01
the children of the 22nd century and
03:04
your names are tell them they'll now will
03:07
like those of each of the children who
03:08
were with us earlier will be forever
03:10
etched on Dearcan na nDaoine in fact it
03:13
was wonderful to see the children
03:15
finding their names on the beautiful
03:17
piece I do want particularly to recall
03:22
Elizabeth O’Carroll who chaired the Bealtaine
03:24
group's input to the project em
03:27
Elizabeth died since the workshop and I
03:31
was very pleased earlier to have the
03:33
opportunity of meeting Tom and you are
03:35
so welcome fíor-chaoin fáilte romhat go?
03:37
speisialta chomh maith
03:41
I know that Elizabeth is not only missed
03:47
of course by her family but by all of
03:49
the members and friends in the Bealtaine
03:51
group since 2012[two thousand and twelve] we've been
03:56
collectively engaged in a period of
03:58
reflection a decade of commemoration on
04:02
the momentous of events of a century ago
04:04
that would lead to why people like me
04:08
and you are standing here in the home
04:10
of the President of Ireland lead to an
04:12
independent state these events led to
04:16
the partition of Ireland and they would
04:17
eventually leave to lead to the
04:19
birth of a republic and it was as we
04:24
were here eh and walking around the the grounds
04:28
that Sabina and I decided that Áras an
04:31
Uachtarán the home of the President of
04:33
Ireland should mark these centenary
04:36
commemorations not only through
04:38
the hosting of events and I think I
04:40
spoke in 2016 at six hundred events but I
04:44
think that we should also  do
04:48
something that would leave a permanent
04:50
artistic reflection and interpretation
04:54
of what we had been doing by way of
04:56
reflection and for example in the same
05:00
spirit next year we will install an
05:03
artwork another one public piece for the
05:07
those who will visit the Áras
05:09
commemorating the 1913 lock out but today
05:13
we're celebra- recalling the Easter
05:15
Rising with what I can just say is I
05:18
believe is a very beautiful new addition
05:20
to the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin what we
05:24
sought was an artistic piece that would
05:26
be an appropriate and permanent tribute
05:28
to the women and men whose effort and
05:31
sacrifice contributed so much to Irish
05:34
freedom that would be a symbol that
05:37
would also serve as an inspiration
05:39
towards realizing the promise of a real
05:43
republic a true Republic which is of
05:46
course a prospect that remains as a
05:48
challenge for us all and will be a
05:51
source of reflection for those who visit
05:53
the beautiful sculpture today I want
05:56
especially to welcome ach go háirithe
05:59
the I want to welcome the relatives of the
06:02
signatories of the proclamation who're
06:04
here and over the other participants in
06:06
the rising of joined us for for this
06:09
occasion fíor-chaoin speisialta 
06:12
fáilte romhaibh a chairde is tá súil a'am go
06:14
mbraitheann sibh go bhfuil Dearcán na nDaoine
06:17
mar shiombal oiriúnach [den fhís a leag bhur ngaolta]
06:20
ós ár gcomhair ar an Luan 
06:23
Cásca sin ós cionn céad bliain ó shin.
06:26
are in I'm so pleased that you have been
06:28
able to join us and I hope that you when
06:31
you visit when you see that you will
06:33
regard it as a worthy symbol of the
06:35
generous actions of your ancestors I
06:38
hope that what we have achieved with
06:40
this commemorative work will be a
06:42
fitting tribute to the memory and vision
06:45
the signatories of the proclamation but
06:48
also all those who stood with them and
06:50
those who would recoil afterwards and
06:54
sup- to their fate and who would be
06:56
part of their vision it is an accolade I
06:59
think to our shared past and it is in
07:02
this way also when you look at the Acorn
07:05
and the time capsule within it it is
07:07
a wonderful a beacon for a brighter
07:11
future all of us as citizens of Ireland
07:14
are now living in an Ireland that was
07:17
shaped by the actions and vision of your
07:19
ancestors who with other men and women
07:22
took to the streets on Easter Monday
07:24
1916 to make a demand for independence
07:28
and to spo- respond directly to the
07:32
consequences of imperialism in Ireland
07:35
there were those who participated were
07:39
women and men who risked everything in
07:41
their different ways fighting for
07:43
freedom and inspired by the declaration
07:46
of a republic and the dream of a better
07:48
fairer inclusive new future and we
07:53
should not forget that the rebels while
07:55
there were a group that had a variety of
07:57
talents tallainne éigine acu
08:00
they had a shared belief in the
08:02
independence of Ireland amongst their
08:05
number were socialists feminists
08:07
Republicans devout Catholics Protestants
08:10
atheists radicals and other ideologies
08:14
and somewhere several of these all at
08:17
the one time but in their different ways
08:20
they shared a dream of an alternative
08:22
existence to that of subjugation of the
08:25
Irish people and their culture and they
08:28
rejected any imposed deference to Empire
08:32
I've mentioned my speeches during 2016
08:36
they emphasized that all of the
08:39
participants in it 1916 and indeed those
08:43
of the decades of the revival that went
08:46
before had come to procede and recoil
08:49
from what was a constant theme in the
08:53
assumptions of the imperialist mind it
08:56
was that those dominated in any
08:58
colony such as Ireland was somehow lesser
09:01
in human terms in language culture and
09:04
politics the historical evidence for
09:07
this view was all around in the
09:11
circumstances of housing hunger
09:14
immigration exclusion language loss and
09:18
above all in cultural assumptions as the
09:22
culture of freedom that was allowed was
09:24
a freedom merely to imitate or a
09:28
suggestion to ingratiate while the
09:31
vision for the future of those we recall
09:33
and honour today was set out in the
09:36
proclamation I think it can I think be
09:39
be viewed in retrospect as a challenge
09:43
which remains for us succeeding
09:46
generations an ideal that has yet to be
09:49
achieved tone blue long on fools it was
09:53
such thoughts and reflections that drove
09:56
sabine and i as we walked around these
09:58
groan to say something must be here to
10:02
sit down a challenge dennis which we
10:04
sought to our own artists in this
10:07
challenge was to capture in the one work
10:09
the foundations we have been bequeathed
10:11
by that
10:13
evolutionary generation and those that
10:16
succeeded the part that all of us are
10:19
called upon and have the opportunity to
10:22
play in our national project our
10:24
national story as we seek to achieve the
10:27
promise and potential of the future for
10:30
all our people so often in my speeches
10:33
of 2016 I spoke about our veteran take
10:37
on children at the on do it to this end
10:40
in 2015 we invited renowned artists and
10:43
sculptors to make proposals for such an
10:46
artwork to be placed here in the grounds
10:49
of arsenic draw on each of the sculptors
10:52
was highly accomplished and they all had
10:54
reputations as exceptional artists who
10:57
were confidential would bring reflective
10:59
and imaginative ideas to the project
11:02
without light we were delighted at the
11:05
positive and enthusiastic response we
11:07
received some of the 14 artists who
11:10
submitted proposals are with us today me
11:13

11:22
I so want to thank you for your
11:25
engagement and for the truly wonderful
11:27
and inspiring ideas that you put forward
11:30
we realized from the beginning the
11:33
choosing all the profound and very
11:35
different from between all the profound
11:37
a very different proposals would require
11:40
the application of exceptional and
11:43
experienced individuals who together
11:45
could discern the most appropriate
11:47
sculpture for its intended session so we
11:52
were absolutely delighted when our very
11:55
first choice of jury members to oversee
11:58
the project that they responded
12:00
positively to our invitation and gave
12:02
freely of their time and energy I so

12:15
and set to the task of making the
12:18
difficult choice a very difficult choice
12:20
which involves several stages of
12:23
consideration interrogation and
12:25
distillation the jury was expertly
12:28
chaired by Katrina Crowe who under whose
12:31
guidance this project ran so smoothly I
12:34
marveled to the country in terms of

mentioned earlier the detail of all this
18:14
work and the craftsmanship involved has
18:17
been captured in video rachel has also
18:19

this public art Commission and tells the

story of Rachel's idea the input of the

hundreds of children and adults and it

19:07
have taken for granted as a profound

and a medium of contemporary culture and
19:14
artistic expression it has now been
19:17
recognized by UNESCO and added to the

and through in regard to the dark honor
20:12
nearly the people's acorn I have decided
20:14
to leave it to Katrina crow to reflect
20:17
more fully on the piece itself survives
20:20
it to say that in our opinion it is
20:23
truly beautiful
20:24
given its symbolism the design
20:26
appropriate that Rachel chose to involve
20:30
hundreds of citizens young and old in
20:33
the execution of her plan and gave them
20:35
the opportunity to include her stories
20:37
and their ideas in the final artwork

so on and it's now done the people's
21:01
acorn will stand in Orson Lutheran as a
21:03
