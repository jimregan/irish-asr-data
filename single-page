ag ‘a t’ [cj] and the verbal noun particle ag [a], [ag], or [aj] {ag rith ‘running’, ag
61 ‘drinking’, ag ithe ‘eating’). Distinguishing between homographs in this way
is im portant because in this case, and in many other cases, homographs are
pronounced differently. For the phonetiser to be able to make the distinction,
first the grammatical information would have first to be obtained, either from a
dictionary or from a part-of-speech tagger (Uf Dhonnchadha & Van Genabith,
2006), and then used to distinguish between homographs. After this, the addition
of a post-lexical module, a module th at deals with cross-word coarticulation and
other phenomena, would enable the phonetiser to select the correct one of the
three possible pronunciations of the verbal noun particle ag ([a], [ag], or [aj]).
Deciding what pronunciation is correct in this case depends on whether or not the
verbal noun begins with a consonant, a back vowel, or a front vowel. The addition
of such modules would constitute a significant enhancement to the phonetiser.
One other possible enhancement would be the full integration of phonetisation
with spell checking. This way, spelling errors could be removed before phonetisation, thus improving the quality of phonetisation, which depends crucially on
the quality of the spelling.
Finally, the extent to which the phonetiser meets some of its stated goals
remains to be seen. For example, while the architecture of the system should
allow a fairly straightforward extension to new dialects by other researchers and
developers, this has not yet been demonstrated. And while the phonetiser has so
far been used to build three synthetic voices th at have been used in a number of
applications, many other applications, such as the use of an extended version of
the phonetiser in electronic dictionaries (see Chapter 8), remain to be explored.
I look forward to working on some of these research questions and also hope
