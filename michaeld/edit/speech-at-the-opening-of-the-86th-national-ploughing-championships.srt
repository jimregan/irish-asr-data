1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:03,253
a dhaoine córa ar an gcéad dul síos

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,880
is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as ucht

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,134
an bhfíorchéad fáilte a d'éirigh sibh go léir romham féin

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,928
is roimh mo bhean chéile Saidhbhín is iadsan atá

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,557
ag taisteal liom is cúis áthas dom i gcónaí

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:20,020
tíocht go dtí an bploughing agus is pribhléid é bheith

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:25,984
in ann í a oscailt an uair seo don ochtú séú chomórtas

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,280
treabhdóireacht na na tíre i must

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,324
say first of all I was bit responsible for the

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,245
being late because i wanted to go and see the horses

11
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,542
and my interview with Sean O'Rourke had delayed me and I didn't

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,171
want in fact actually to cut the time from the horses

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,674
which are really the beginning of all of this and it is so

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,345
important but every time i come here to the ploughing

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,682
Sabina and I eh are marvel at the sheer size

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,645
scale and energy of what is called the ploughing and this year

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,272
with the weather

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,277
may it hold and a eh the wha cuh the numbers

19
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,072
will no doubt go up and it's marvellous to be

20
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,658
here at the eighty sixth national ploughing championship in Screggan

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,536
county Offaly and that's a venue that has

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,207
proved so attractive and successful that last year it welcomed

23
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,043
two hundred and eighty three thousand people over

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,171
the three days with all the chances that this year

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,384
the attendance will go well over three hundred thousand I

26
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,928
think that the it is it has grown as you have

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,682
just heard the chairman say into not just

28
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:43,103
a massive mm public event for rural people in Ireland

29
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,399
but it's one of europe's largest outdoor events and

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,778
what comes into existence uh is a near miracle

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,323
an instant temporary town which comes almost over

32
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,785
night in the heart of the countryside and it does so with the

33
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,122
cooperation of so many people but the festival is a

34
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:06,751
testament to the vibrancy and the organisational talent that

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,338
is there in Ireland's farming community so is mian liom

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,009
[] ar fad i want to congratulate and

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,721
thank our hosts the neighbouring farmers who have facilitated

38
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:22,392
the transformation of six hundred acres of farmland although

39
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,645
i'm told this morning it's nearer to seven hundred into

40
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,981
Ireland's farming capital city

41
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,900
at I think the community effort required in that

42
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,487
is a marvelous should encourage all of us

43
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,199
and i think expansion and development of the event is due in

44
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,327
such large measure to the dedication of the national

45
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,205
ploughing association's organising team

46
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,793
including its indomitable formidable managing director of four

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:57,844
decades anna may mchugh [applause] i think that the

48
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,307
commitment of the organising group their enthusiasm but

49
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,768
above all else and which is admired far

50
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,688
and wide their professionalism allows all of us year after

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,775
year to come here and enjoy these days together

52
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,070
and they have wonderful cooporation

53
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,114
from Offaly county coucil the gardai the many

54
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,452
clubs rural organisations that all come together in a great act

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,539
of enthusiasm and cooperation to make this festival possible

56
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,753
but i think that cooporation is an essential part of rural life

57
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,423
and i think you have created and sustained it in these

58
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,720
championship making it the most important enjoyable celebration of rural Ireland

59
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,264
rural Ireland in all it's aspects

60
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,974
and an annual tribute

61
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,935
to those who farm

62
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,146
and to those who are the custodians because they are farming

63
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,067
of not only our food but also our society

64
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,655
our landscapes our natural environment and our way of life

65
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,535
and it's important to stress that these championships the ploughing

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,580
they're an annual opportunity also for those who have moved

67
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,998
to our towns and cities

68
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,627
to come back and restore their connection with

69
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,964
the rural communities and the land that we're none of us are

70
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,298
very far from

71
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,761
and i think a chairde these days are a celebration

72
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,222
and an opportunity i want to say

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,351
as well to take note of the profound role

74
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,855
that farmers and farming plays in our society

75
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,400
it's a role that can never be fully understood

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,071
in the market figures and sale statistics of a of a sector

77
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,619
these indicators are very important they may be important indicators but

78
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,331
they don't fully take into account maybe the importance

79
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,083
of farming as a way of life

80
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,337
above all else family farming

81
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,547
and it's so good to see people of

82
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,508
all ages here and particularly so many young people

83
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,137
it's something that connects us all of us to nature

84
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,973
but it also transfers not only the knowledge

85
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:12,020
of food security and it's importance from generation to generation

86
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,607
but also very valuable lore of understanding

87
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,904
that comes from being close to soil animals plants

88
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,198
it is a valuable way of life

89
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,075
it needs nurture it

90
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,536
needs support it needs understanding

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,917
it needs good social policies as well as economic and price interventions

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,587
and among the stands that i will be visiting today

93
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,007
i'm a the is will be the stand teagasc

94
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,386
and as I was preparing my notes

95
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,139
i was very indebted to a paper written by david meredith

96
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,185
on the challenges that are now facing rural communities

97
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,105
that paper drew on for example among other

98
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,150
things the national farm summary of two thousand and fifteen

99
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,570
that showed that one farm in three

100
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,241
in fact thirty four percent were vulnerable

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,036
they were vulnerable because they didn't have an off source of

102
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,998
income to farmer or spouse and thus and he said

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,877
concluded that these are the farmers that need care the

104
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,505
farms that need care because they may not be viable

105
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:26,052
my message is simple as president of ireland farming has

106
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,053
to be supported

107
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,890
as part of our economy yes the agrifood sector

108
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,560
is our largest indigenous industry

109
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,731
and its contribution to the national and global production of food

110
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:43,236
for an expanding population is significant and since it operates in

111
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,574
our rural communities it provides sources of income and employment

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,577
but it also makes use of the natural

113
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,288
capital resources of our environment

114
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,876
it accounts for more than eh eleven billion

115
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,464
of our exports a hundred and sixty thousand jobs

116
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,551
ireland's agriculture has been and continues to

117
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,055
be central to the shaping of the future of our country

118
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,517
and our society of that eleven billion and this is

119
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,311
why this year is an important year that needs

120
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,395
all our support

121
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,317
forty percent of it it depends on our market with the united kingdom

122
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,155
but farming as a crucial element of society is vulnerable

123
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,907
all over europe

124
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,286
and ireland is no exception and we are challenged to address issues

125
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,498
like the succession issue the challenging

126
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,791
other words put simply

127
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,337
of offering a future to the next generation of educated young

128
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,634
farmers and they are educated bright young farmers boys and girls

129
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:53,640
acknowledging these factors requires acknowledgment of something that is a

130
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,686
concern for all of us and that is the unbalanced nature

131
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,521
of development in ireland

132
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,733
that unbalanced development is leaving us with

133
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,653
rural depletion in some parts and then

134
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,449
also the other side of the coin our urban diseconomies

135
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,453
two sides of the same coin something that affects those who

136
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,499
work in agriculture live in rural ireland and make their living in the land

137
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,504
but also it affects the whole of society losing

138
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:30,385
infrastructure in rural areas crowded cities with inadequate services and

139
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,720
social cohesion

140
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,390
which must be the what we all aim for not

141
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,935
only in ireland but europe and the world  that means

142
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,312
having a balanced economy and society

143
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,441
and that aim many years ago when

144
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,442
i was starting out

145
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,194
was one of the principal reasons why we

146
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,948
had a discussion on regionalism and regional planning

147
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,994
it became unfashionable it fell out of favour

148
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,415
i didn't say to rodney king was predict what we

149
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,209
need to region and thinking and planning again

150
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,379
and when you're at a news is brought up with

151
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,381
an active adequate infrastructure

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,760
with an exodus of the armed people are now slowly

153
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,304
it's not being as good a job right names as

154
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,973
my own is is an asset was only by those

155
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,933
affected by for all of us

156
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,563
some of them voted to these days i regarded as an okay

157
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,984
because they are the agents and the cities and seventy

158
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,946

166
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,270
this is something we have to address it creates apnea

167
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,939
it saddens our policy

168
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,733
in those areas as part of it as it is

169

00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:52,110
that admits that thomas think crap

179
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,032
it was clearly is a nineteen days on the path

180
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,700
as a consensus oh

181
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,038
most of us notion infrastructure and i've been road you've

182
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,165
got the nation and vicious cycle

183
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,127
and i think it's the obvious what is the prize

184
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,672
is the intervention no maughan in relation to that sages

185
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:17,135
as dated say it applies the activity of enacted on

186
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,762
secretary of state

187
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,099
i think about artist made dad effects of this city

188
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,228
when the bluth max did seats back instead the city

189
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,441
plan to exoneration very serious than anticipated

190
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,237
i'll be inadequate service provision scholar that crowd get red

191
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,075
herrings that can see at about seven or that and

192
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,329
then of course there are other specific issues associated with

193
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,246
life in this city

194
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,416
spiraling costs associated with housing

195
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,420
and our associated with bullets speculation and to be added

196
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:57,300
a provision of housing on conservation disillusioned fragmentation

197
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,596
would yell at me that i denied today i want to say

198
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,598
we should try megan

199
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,019
the case that is there are patterns legion idea that

200
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,399
having a lot to make amends should she be at madison society

201
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,362
and the giants are providing and revitalizing rhode island

202
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,157
the n. not talking about it as a kind of

203
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,660
a case you have to respect the day that no

204
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,411
way of life

205
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,621
and it is tempting we eat

206
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,499
it's like a great challenges that are trying

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,210
it's one that can and must be next

208
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,254
can i take it as well

209
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,216
is that the the negatives about mars and venus griping

210
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,554
we have the means to science and technology and communications

211
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,515
to the jaw that the defense cuts is that outpaced

212
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:50,603
the thermal community and as a direct relationship between ronald

213
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:56,192
ronald b. is this promenade main infrastructure and was that be described

214
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,614
i didn't associate kite technology and science

215
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,578
crafted infrastructure expenditure of economic social and take it that time

216
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,788
and it has achieved our charts

217
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,417
an awesome by prince by you know it's a new

218
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,710
disease is not in evidence

219
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,507
it's not the result awesome natural phenomena as they did

220
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,761
a hideous some way of the work that jacket is

221
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,847
the case now and there is at it sounds as

222
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,140
nice and small

223
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,685
our fate has to make choices at human is effect

224
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,103
that the that'd be described

225
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,980
there are choices

226
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,150
there are fading and our state change

227
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,904
and we need to go we envision it imagination if

228
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,614
they don't be late bath

229
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,157
i think

230
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,910
something that's been parked

231
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,914
is that important that that then last thing we get

232
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,334
away from over to buy between city and caught

233
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,379
if there are problems in the wooten is in the

234
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,466
population yeah kind of easy to that problem is all

235
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,136
kinds population increase in the city and i'm making my

236
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,598
case i gain for me to that because by the

237
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,102
visiting our address is that in fact it's absolutely do

238
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,980
not plan by this thing and ruined infrastructure transport and

239
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:20,068
brought back by providing good business at all i get

240
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,655
a grasp that made a profit important for people to

241
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,701
go back again and a great flirting ignites the dullest

242
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,204
towns and villages where you see too many businesses fellas

243
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:39,504
got hump and added friend i felt as far as

244
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,338
the point of view

245
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,676
this is easily get it basically do that because they

246
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,304
only need aspiring india's economy and then i

247
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:53,685
in continue interaction between added run exchanges would be sustainable

248
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,273
yes it is next year at into the white sustained

249
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,777
did yeah marks the end of second anniversary of the

250
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,990
adoption of the two thousand and the sustainable development goal

251
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,202
when the great achievements of my time is present in

252
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,581
two thousand eighty to all our hearts need to we

253
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,959
we have all been asked to radically rethink our approach

254
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:18,752
to the economy

255
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,422
treads threads that ellis island i see that was then

256
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,426
that maybe late last week that natural why are animal

257
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,720
is that we've been asked to do is that they

258
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,681
get great go to our mad man and woman knows

259
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:36,478
that he can now and he lobbied the he says

260
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,314
the idea we have to do it if

261
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,948
that's that's where i says by the r. j. r.

262
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,327
our generation but the rule that the generations to come

263
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,163
and dole is both need all of our civil war

264
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,874
and it's good to see all the young people predicted

265
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,627
vichy year here i will take at least go and

266
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,922
make fill it in the giant no solid colors of

267
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,425
the apartment at x. good farming

268
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,380
that's a classic station and farm

269
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
that applies to you do now

270
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:10,178
between five and seven sons and daughters and maps and

271
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,722
i think that is that it is one of the

272
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,807
test of our time

273
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,894
you know when behind we will resume at that rate

274
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,772
by doesn't that mean then that the head of the

275
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,901
sector in agriculture must include although so far

276
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,487
and as latest project ten inches too

277
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,866
yes it is possible across the atlantic avenue to magic

278
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,912
kind yes sally management and that is as to the

279
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,330
renewable energy

280
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,083
new policy to many spaceship many

281
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,837
education system that takes the concept of richness of their

282
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:48,633
own experience so sensitive and al at that he didn't

283
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:53,013
do was we say describing assets internationally in foreign policy

284
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,973
olive that mutating

285
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,561
must be beaten us thrown away and as artifacts an

286
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,979
and I think that is very important

287
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,024
that's a one of the great successes when i go

288
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,359
to build a way that comes out

289
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,196
is the importance now that the text internationally and it's

290
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,282
going to be dead and that it's less as we

291
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,618
speak to retain i'll knock heads for that because her

292
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,328
projects face it is

293
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,290
but i do want to say this is way out

294
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,960
we need say today he not only in the projects

295
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:28,131
from full extent of the drug activity said we need

296
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,926
say sedated he's every stage of production at least at

297
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,597
safe and about to leave that the venue as haley

298
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:39,726
states to adapt to their weekend caught at it we

299
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,227
don't have a divinity

300
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,440
i had to that made with daddy by tuesday about

301
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,319
acting is largesse of all we said yesterday that just

302
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:53,239
makes it necessary to ensure that there are their transactions

303
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,993
between those who refuse bill to practice for the retail

304
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:05,418
sector and those who've been filled up one and i

305
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,214
think you fools wisely date sweetie pie has that

306
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,343
environment is as big a vision and economics as they

307
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:17,389
did anything anywhere and compliments it i'm one cabinet he

308
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,307
cheats at the expense of the yacht

309
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,604
i see a product that document going to these guys have budgets

310
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:29,150
iran great opportunity to send a great tradition not i'd

311
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:34,447
get a hat imagination and principally about farming sector and

312
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,409
i need we need to mobilize all of the madness

313
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,412
of our society in haiti the day that i can

314
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,499
describe believe him out of rotting food production we came

315
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,294
and carves out with a dish a new ideas you

316
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,549
escape and met with any bank that dennis franz had

317
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,470
any information and exchanging best practice at cross and major garrett

318
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:58,972
thought

319
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,184
out yeah they have pot belly like a means and

320
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,604
so on that in about two outfits that and that

321
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,482
is what is the day in part to easy so

322
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,610
much more than a sector and we have gone this

323
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,364
is one good example of federal programs that could or

324
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,492
boudreau grab the j. c. a different approach to fighting

325
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,037
and conservation from the ground up

326
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,539
analysts i want to see as as as well

327
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,294
a happier place for some animosity well if that is saying

328
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,755
wet blood stains that made a bayonet

329
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,383
i'm really implemented and a lady who after goldfarb

330
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,260
and i had id

331
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,722
we must don't cooperate in dealing with what it really

332
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,351
is not discuss and that is correct yes i think

333
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,395
we've lost that just getting into the rise in lagos

334
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,231
in fact it did in our maybe because of its

335
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,526
age of the cards i had talked to president of

336
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,613
bosnia as part of the advertising sector goes to the

337
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,906
united kingdom out

338
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,033
well is that all this

339
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:03,745
don't you consume irish film know that i guess in

340
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,999
the best quality hello dreyfus was held at all events

341
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,960
felt that while we have had faith that they've been

342
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,631
to get ready to costume with a sense to you

343
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,884
and i aced a seven and brought up and yet

344
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,346
we would go and find you laughed when we mistake

345
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,057
did your the markets we had and that's why i

346
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,018
think it's a vote that that meant as a key

347
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,313
in recognition of the vatican and eat about that in

348
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,483
every exit and go see it no we don't need

349
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,070
i have bought the only yes we do want to

350
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,490
see me about goldman and yet we want to attack

351
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,243
the state with sector that are very important to us

352
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,829
and they want the job done or not

353
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,083
